The Sales Catalogs dataset is offered under the Creative Commons [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).

## Dataset Description & Scope

This dataset contains more than 1 million sale content records, over 22,000 sale description records, and over 50,000 sales catalogs information records. The sale description records describe the sale catalogs at the document level. The content records represent the lots that appear in the sale catalogs; a lot may refer to one or more objects. Every content record is associated with a description record. For some sale catalogs, there may be a sale description record without any sale content records.

There are three separate tables linked by `catalog_number` that make up the Sales Catalogs dataset:

1. `sales_contents`: information about the individual lots in each sale (delivered in 13 files)
2. `sales_descriptions`: information about the sale catalogs
3. `sales_catalogs_info`: information on the known locations of physical copies of the sale catalogs

The Sales Catalogs dataset includes data from two types of sale catalogs: most of the sales represent auctions, but a small number of private contract sales are also included. Typically published by auction houses and dealers, auction sale catalogs list works of art that were offered for sale at public auction. Catalogs for private contract sales list objects for sale that collectors could purchase at set or negotiated prices during an extended period of exhibition.

This dataset includes catalogs from major cities in Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia from 1650 to 1850, and from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland from 1900 to 1945. Coverage varies by country. The most comprehensive coverage for each country is shown below.

- Austria: 1900-1945
- Belgium: 1701-1840
- France: 1701-1820
- Germany: 1671-1800 and 1900-1945
- Great Britain: 1681-1840
- The Netherlands: 1671-1740 and 1801-1820
- Scandinavia: 1671-1800
- Switzerland: 1900-1945

The dataset focuses on paintings, drawings, sculptures, miniatures, enamels, and tapestries, but the scope varies by country and time period. Catalogs are included as long as they have objects in scope, even if those make up only a small percentage of objects in a sale. However, only objects in scope are included and the rest are excluded. Read more about the coverage here: <http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/charts.html>.

The level of description of the objects in the catalogs varies. Entries generally include an artist's name, if known, and a basic description of the object. Some entries have more detailed descriptions, including dimensions, materials, provenance information, and starting and/or estimated prices. Sale content records are also enhanced with additional information, when available, including seller and buyer names, selling prices, previous and post sale and owner information, and present locations. This additional information may come from annotated copies of the catalog, including annotations by the auctioneer of the sale. Information may also come from published sale results. When possible, standardized forms of artist, buyer, and seller names have been provided. Names that were printed in the catalog by the auctioneer, such as sellers and artists, were intended to be recognized by the public attending the sales and, therefore, most of these people have been identified. Seller and buyer names that were added by hand to a catalog copy by the auctioneer, however, were intended for internal use and often include only a surname. These names are much more difficult to associate with identified individuals. Such identifications have been made, when possible, but in many cases we do not know more than the fact that it was an unspecified person with this surname.

## General editorial guidelines

Primarily, the dataset is a "verbatim" transcription of the sales catalogs, meaning the editors transcribed exactly what was printed in the source materials. Standardized information was then added in order to improve searching. Information added by editors can appear in English, French, or German, based on geographic region. Sales that took place in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia have editorial notes in English. Sales that took place in France have editorial notes in French. Sales that took place in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland have editorial notes in German. English title translations have also been provided for Scandinavian sales.

- In the artist, seller, and buyer fields, any verbatim text in the catalog that indicates repetition of the name above, such as `ditto`, `do`, or `idem`, has been replaced with the actual name being referenced. In the title field, however, these verbatim text terms have been retained and are followed, in brackets, by the text being referenced.
- Information that appears in brackets has been added by editors. If no artist was provided in the catalog, the artist name has been entered as `[Anonymous]`, `[Anonyme]`, or `[Anonym]`. If no title was provided in the catalog, the title has been entered as `[Untitled]`, `[Sans titre]`, or `[Ohne titel]`. If the verbatim artist name for a content record has been inferred from the title page of the catalog, the name will appear in brackets. If the verbatim seller name has come from a source other than the catalog, the name will appear in brackets. Additional bracketed information in the title is typically explained in the Notes field.
- If `<br>` appears in the data, it indicates a link break. This may occur in any of fields with `alphabetic` in the `data_type` column below.
- Names of artists, buyers, and sellers of a work are validated by an internal authority database, which is the source of authority names and nationalities. Most artists have been validated, but a number of buyers and sellers have yet to be fully researched so the corresponding authority fields may be empty.
- The `title` field contains the description of the object as it appears in the catalog. Examples are: `Landscape with cattle,` or `Virgin and child with two saints, the colouring very good.` Very rarely does the description include an official title, such as `The Aldobrandini Wedding,` or `La Gioconda.`
- For British sales:
  - the sales location `London` refers to the current geographical boundaries for Greater London.
  - prices given in pounds are usually listed as pounds and shillings (e.g., 2-10). Pence are usually omitted.
- For posthumous sales, the decedent has been considered the `seller,` even though, technically, it was the person's estate or heirs selling the objects.
- Sale lots that include multiple objects have been divided into separate records, when necessary, such as when a lot includes two objects by two different artists or when the objects were sold separately. Lots that have been split can be identified by `[a]`, `[b]`, etc. appended to the lot number. An explanation is provided in the `title modifier`.
