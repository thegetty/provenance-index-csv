## License

The Knoedler stock books dataset is offered under the Creative Commons [CC0 1.0 Universal
Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).

## Dataset Description & Scope

This dataset contains more than 40,000 records transcribed from the [11 painting
stock books](http://hdl.handle.net/10020/2012m54s1a)  and enhanced with
information from the [21 paintings and watercolors sales
books](http://hdl.handle.net/10020/2012m54s2ny) of
M. Knoedler & Co. in New York (1872-1970). [Read more about the
extensive Knoedler archive containing these
books.](http://www.getty.edu/research/special_collections/notable/knoedler.html)

In general, stock books are administered by galleries and art dealers to
record information about works of art that come into their inventories.
Information from these stock books, of which the Knoedler stock books
are a prime example, includes the date of acquisition, name and address
of the seller, dimensions of the artwork, name of the buyer, date of
sale, and the selling price. In this dataset, information obtained from
stock books was supplemented with information from the sales books,
including buyer and seller names and locations, titles of artworks, and
purchase prices not identified in the stock books. As such, the dataset
may not contain information regarding works that were sent to the
Knoedler Gallery on consignment, or objects in other media such as
watercolors (although fewer than 600 watercolors are covered in the
stock books). Most of the information provided is written in English,
but some entries are in French, German, or Italian. Some handwritten
notes may not be included. 

# Data Dictionary & Editorial Guidelines

## General editorial guidelines

Primarily, the dataset is a "verbatim" transcription of the stock books,
meaning the editors transcribed exactly what was written in the source
materials. However, as with many historical documents, there are
inconsistencies and irregularities. To achieve a high level of accuracy
and clarity, editorial changes were made during and post-transcription:

-   Wherever possible, editors replaced shortcuts such as `do`, `idem`,
    a hashmark (`#`), or double quote mark (`"`) with the actual word or
    name being referenced. 

-   Abbreviations may be spelled out.

-   Titles in brackets were added by PSCP from further research and the
    source of such information is included. The title `[Untitled]` was
    added when a title could not be found. The title `Untitled` without
    brackets is verbatim from the stock book. See the `notes`
    column below for more details about the use of brackets in specific
    fields. 

-   If `<br>` appears in the data, it indicates a link break. This
    may occur in any of fields with `alphabetic` in the `data_type`
    column below.

-   Names of artists, buyers, and sellers of a work are validated by an
    internal authority database, which is the source of authority
    names, nationalities, and locations. Most artists have been
    validated, but a number of buyers and sellers have yet to be fully
    researched so the corresponding authority fields may be empty.

-   Knoedler was not consistent or explicit in their recording of
    purchase and sales prices. As a result, prices may have been entered
    based on context clues as opposed to verbatim. Such prices appear in
    brackets.
